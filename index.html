	<h1>Hi There...</h1>
	<p>I'm Eric Moyer... engineer, data scientist, programmer, educator.</p>

        <p>I also go by "ridercoach" on GitHub and Kaggle, which was an accident, 
           but it'll do.</p>

        <p>Things that energize me:</p>
        <ul>
           <li class="home">Bringing order out of chaos</li> 
           <li class="home">Finding the signal in the noise</li> 
           <li class="home">Helping others grow</li>
        </ul>
