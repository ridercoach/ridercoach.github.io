	<h1>Hi There...</h1>
	<p>I'm Eric Moyer... engineer, programmer, data explorer, educator.</p>

        <p>I also go by "ridercoach" on Github and Kaggle, which was an accident, 
           but I'm okay with it.</p>

        <p>In addition to bringing order out of chaos (in a data sense,) one of 
           the things that most energizes me is helping others build their skills.</p>

        <p>This website helps me do those things.</p>
