	<h1>Hi There...</h1>
	<p>I'm Eric Moyer... engineer, programmer, data explorer, educator.</p>

        <p>I also go by "ridercoach" on GitHub and Kaggle, which was an accident, 
           but it'll do.</p>

        <p>Two things that energize me:</p>
        <ul>
           <li class="home">bringing order out of chaos (especially in data)</li> 
           <li class="home">helping others build their skills</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This website helps me do those things.</p>
