## PLAsTiCC Astronomical Classification Challenge

The goal of the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification 
Challenge is to develop algorithms to process the huge stream of data 
that will come from a unique new telescope being constructed in Chile, 
expected to discover 10 to 100 times more time-varying astronomical 
sources than ever before known.  The time-series nature of this data 
will be a good application for some kind of recurrent neural network.
