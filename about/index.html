title: A Little of My Story

	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
 
        <p>After earning a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Drexel University, I took a 
           job with a company that developed fuzes (as in ordnance, where they spell
           fuze with a "z".)  I wrote a lot of simulation software and designed a few  
           optical systems.  I worked with some interesting folks,
           such as the man who led the development 
           of the world's first sea-skimming missile.  I even learned a little Hebrew.  But
           I wanted more coding, so I moved on.</p>

        <p>I found a position as a programmer with Primavera Systems, a vendor of project 
           management software.  I threw myself into an ocean of old FORTRAN code and did 
           a great job maintaining and enhancing increasingly large portions of it. 
           I also created (in C) the first version of their Custom Report Writer (and learned 
           years later that the reports it generated were pivot tables.)</p>

        <p>The advent of MS Windows at Primavera caused a massive shift in 
           development, away from the data and algorithms and toward the UI, and eventually 
           I was included in a series of layoffs as the company restructured its talent pool 
           according to its new priorities.</p> 

        <p>I landed at a small data processing company, which is where I currently work.  My 
           responsibilities in this position are astoundingly diverse, but I still often find 
           myself massaging data (both in my day job and as a consultant,) either by 
           writing code in Python or some other language, or by using tools such as Pandas and 
           MS Excel.</p>
