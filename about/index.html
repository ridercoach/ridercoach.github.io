title: A Little of My Story

	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
 
        <p>After earning a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Drexel University, I took a 
           job with a company that developed fuzes (as in ordnance, where they spell
           fuze with a "z".)  I wrote a lot of simulation software and designed a few  
           optical systems.  I worked with some interesting folks,
           such as the man who led the development 
           of the world's first sea-skimming missile.  I even learned a little Hebrew.  But
           I wanted more coding, so I moved on.</p>

        <p>I found a position as a programmer with Primavera Systems, a vendor of project 
           management software.  I threw myself into an ocean of old FORTRAN code and did 
           a great job maintaining and enhancing increasingly large portions of it. 
           I also created (in C) the first version of their Custom Report Writer (and learned 
           years later that the reports it generated were pivot tables.)</p>

        <p>The advent of MS Windows at Primavera caused a huge shift in 
           development, and eventually 
           I was included in a series of layoffs as the company restructured its talent pool.</p>

        <p>I landed at a small data processing company, where I still work.  My 
           responsibilities in this position are astoundingly diverse, but I still often find 
           myself massaging data (both in my day job and as a consultant.)  The most exciting thing 
           I did recently in this job was moving the company into the AWS Cloud.</p>

        <p>Now I'm going deeper into data science by exploring areas 
           new to me, such as Machine Learning, and by strengthening my grasp of subjects I learned as an 
           engineer (statistics, linear algebra, etc.)</p>

        <p>I'm looking for opportunities to bring order out of chaos and help others grow.</p>
